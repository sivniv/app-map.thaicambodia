Failed to parse conflict analysis response: The provided content does not contain any specific details about the Thailand-Cambodia conflict, casualties, affected population, weapons used, economic impact, or diplomatic activities. Therefore, the JSON data remains largely unchanged, with the exception of the "diplomacy" section where the "tension" is set to 1, indicating a low level of tension, and the "statements" is set to 1, reflecting the statement made by China. The confidence score remains low due to the lack of detailed information.
